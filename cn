ðŸ”¹ Core CN Concepts
1. Computer Network

Q: What is a Computer Network?
A: A collection of interconnected devices that communicate and share resources.

Types: LAN, MAN, WAN, PAN

Models: OSI (7 layers), TCP/IP (4 layers)

2. OSI Model (7 Layers)

Physical â€“ Transmission of bits (cables, signals).

Data Link â€“ Error detection, MAC addressing (Ethernet).

Network â€“ Routing, logical addressing (IP).

Transport â€“ Reliable delivery, TCP/UDP.

Session â€“ Manages sessions between applications.

Presentation â€“ Data translation, encryption, compression.

Application â€“ End-user services (HTTP, FTP, DNS).

3. TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)

Application (HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP)

Transport (TCP â€“ reliable, UDP â€“ fast)

Internet (IP, ICMP, ARP)

Network Access (Ethernet, Wi-Fi)

4. Switching & Routing

Switching: Data Link layer, forwards using MAC addresses.

Routing: Network layer, forwards using IP addresses.

Devices: Hub, Switch, Router.

5. IP Addressing

IPv4: 32-bit, written as 192.168.1.1.

IPv6: 128-bit, written in hex.

Subnetting: Divides networks for efficiency.

Classes: A, B, C (based on leading bits).

6. Protocols

TCP: Reliable, connection-oriented.

UDP: Fast, connectionless.

HTTP/HTTPS: Web communication.

FTP: File transfer.

SMTP/IMAP/POP3: Email.

DNS: Domain name resolution.

DHCP: Dynamic IP allocation.

7. Transmission Modes

Simplex â€“ One-way.

Half-Duplex â€“ Both directions but one at a time.

Full-Duplex â€“ Both directions simultaneously.

8. Transmission Media

Guided: Twisted pair, Coaxial, Fiber optic.

Unguided: Radio, Microwave, Infrared.

9. Error Detection & Control

Parity Bit â€“ Simple error check.

Checksum â€“ Verifies data integrity.

CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) â€“ Detects burst errors.

ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) â€“ Ensures reliable transmission.

10. Flow Control & Congestion Control

Flow Control: Stop-and-Wait, Sliding Window.

Congestion Control: TCP Tahoe, Reno.

11. Multiple Access Protocols

ALOHA â€“ Random transmission.

CSMA/CD â€“ Ethernet (detects collisions).

CSMA/CA â€“ Wi-Fi (avoids collisions).

12. Network Devices

Hub â€“ Broadcasts to all.

Switch â€“ Uses MAC, reduces collisions.

Router â€“ Uses IP, connects networks.

Gateway â€“ Connects different protocols.

13. DNS & DHCP

DNS: Converts domain name â†’ IP.

DHCP: Assigns dynamic IPs automatically.

14. Firewalls & Security

Firewall: Blocks unauthorized access.

Encryption: SSL/TLS for secure communication.

Attacks: DoS, DDoS, Phishing, Man-in-the-Middle.

15. CN Concepts Quick Recall (Interview)

OSI = 7 layers, TCP/IP = 4 layers.

IP = Logical addressing, MAC = Physical addressing.

TCP = Reliable, UDP = Fast.

DNS = Name to IP, DHCP = IP allocation.

Switch = MAC, Router = IP.

Congestion Control = TCP Tahoe/Reno.

Error Detection = Parity, CRC, Checksum.
