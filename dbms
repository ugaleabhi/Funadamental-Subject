ðŸ“Œ DBMS Short Notes (Interview POV)
1. Basics

DBMS = Software to manage, store, and retrieve data efficiently.

Difference: DBMS vs RDBMS â†’ RDBMS uses relations (tables), supports normalization & constraints.

2. Keys

Primary Key â†’ Uniquely identifies a record.

Candidate Key â†’ Multiple options for Primary Key.

Foreign Key â†’ Links two tables.

Composite Key â†’ Combination of two or more attributes.

Super Key â†’ Any attribute(s) that can identify a record uniquely.

3. Normalization

Removes redundancy & anomalies.

1NF â†’ Atomic values.

2NF â†’ No partial dependency.

3NF â†’ No transitive dependency.

BCNF â†’ Stronger version of 3NF.

4. Indexing

Improves retrieval speed.

Clustered Index â†’ Changes physical order of rows.

Non-clustered Index â†’ Only creates a reference.

5. Transactions & Properties

Transaction = Sequence of operations performed as a single unit.

ACID properties:

Atomicity â†’ All or nothing.

Consistency â†’ DB remains valid.

Isolation â†’ Transactions execute independently.

Durability â†’ Once committed, data persists.

6. Concurrency Control

Problems: Deadlock, Lost Update, Dirty Read, Phantom Read.

Solutions: Locking (Shared & Exclusive), Timestamp ordering.

7. Joins (Concept)

Inner Join â†’ Common values.

Left Join â†’ All from left + matching right.

Right Join â†’ All from right + matching left.

Full Join â†’ All from both tables.

8. Views

Virtual table, does not store data.

Used for security & abstraction.

9. Stored Procedures & Triggers

Procedure â†’ Precompiled SQL block.

Trigger â†’ Auto executed on event (Insert/Update/Delete).

10. ER Model

Entity â†’ Object.

Attributes â†’ Properties of entity.

Relationship â†’ Association between entities.

11. File Organization

Heap file â†’ Unordered.

Sequential file â†’ Ordered.

Hashing â†’ Direct access.

12. Recovery Techniques

Backup & Log-based recovery.

Checkpoints used for faster recovery.
